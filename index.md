## Workshops available

I can offer the following workshops. If there's another topic you're interested in please get in
touch and I'll see what I can do.

### Longer workshops, 1.5–2 hours

These are generally aimed at intermediate dancers, or fast beginners with experience of other dance
styles. Some can also be adapted to be more beginner-friendly.

#### Connection and partnering

This workshop will explore a series of exercises to help you be aware of your own body, connect with
the music and a partner, and lead and follow a variety of movement. We’ll then apply what you have
learnt to some of the partnered dances common in balfolk such as schottische and mazurka.

Some previous dance experience is helpful but not required, and no familiarity with balfolk is
assumed. While we will be working mostly in the context of balfolk, the principles are relevant to
almost any partnered dance (swing, blues, salsa, even contra). This workshop will be taught
'switch': everyone will learn to both lead and follow. It should be useful for everyone from
beginners to experts, either way there'll be something for you to get out of it.

#### Three Ways to Waltz

What is a waltz? We’ll look at the differences between three different styles of waltz (American
folk waltz / rotary waltz, balfolk waltz and Swedish waltz), and how differences in the music lead
to difference in pulse, frame, movement and connection.

This workshop is most helpful for people who know at least one kind of waltz already, and want to
learn more about different ways to waltz.

#### Waltzing from 1 to 11

An introduction to balfolk waltzes, regular and irregular. We’ll start by getting the basics of a
regular 3-time waltz, talking about how a typical balfolk style of waltz differs from other kinds
of waltz, and then see how far we can get with irregular waltzes in 5, 8 or even 11.

Wear smooth-soled shoes that you can turn easily in. You don’t need to know how to waltz to take
this workshop, but familiarity with connection in some kind of partner dance is helpful.

#### Four Dimensions of Balfolk Variations

You know the basic steps of some balfolk dances, now what? Balfolk is all about improvisation, so
let's add some variations to your toolbox. We'll look at four dimensions of variation: direction,
rhythm, weight and style.

Before taking this workshop you should be comfortable leading and following schottische, waltz and
mazurka.

### Short intro workshops, 30 minutes to 1 hour

These are all suitable for people with no prior experience of the various dances, but should also be
useful for those who have come across them before to improve their technique.

#### Bourrée 2t technique and variations

We’ll talk about the typical pulse and rhythm of a 2-time bourrée, the basic movement and how to
change the steps to give more energy and drive to the dance. We’ll use eye contact with our partner
to match energy, pulse and size of our steps, and then explore some simple variations to make the
dance more interesting.

#### Schottische

We’ll learn the basic steps of a balfolk schottische along with some tips for leading and following.
We’ll then learn some common figures to add variety to the dance.

#### Rondeau in couple

Rondeau in couple is danced not just with a partner but with the whole room of people. We’ll
introduce the basic rondeau step, with its characteristic pulse and drive, and then find out how to
connect with the rest of the room. If times permits we’ll also cover a few common variations.

#### Rond de St Vincent

We’ll learn the simple basic step of this dance and see how it fits together with the characteristic
arm movements. We’ll make sure we have a good comfortable and relaxed connection, and see how much
fun it can be when we dance with energy and speed.

#### Rond de Landela

#### Rond d'Argenton
